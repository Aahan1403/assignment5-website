AI Development Notes — Assignment 5: Personal Website
Prompt 1 (Main)
Prompt: 
I need to build a professional personal website for my IT assignment in VS Code. It should include six pages (Home, About, Resume, Projects, Contact, and Thank You). I want a clean, modern design in navy blue and white something that looks professional for recruiters. Can you guide me through creating all the HTML, CSS, and structure from scratch?”

AI Output Summary:
The AI provided a complete project plan and generated all page templates (index, about, resume, projects, contact, and thankyou) along with a professional CSS theme in navy and royal blue. It also included responsive design, accessible navigation, and form validation logic for the contact page.

Decision:  
Accepted the overall layout and structure. Minor color and spacing adjustments were made during testing in VS Code to match my preferred balance and alignment.

Prompt 2
Prompt:  
Make the site look more balanced remove blank space on the right side of the projects page and expand the text area.

AI Output Summary:
The AI rewrote the CSS grid for the Projects section, adjusting the columns to `3fr 1.2fr`, which gave a wider text column and cleaner alignment without empty space.

Decision: 
Accepted. This fixed the layout and made the projects page look much more professional and proportionate.

Some quick prompts such as for spacing or alignment were sent as well, but these were the primary prompts used.

Prompt  
Write me a short professional ‘About Me’ section using details from my resume.

AI Output Summary:
The AI used key points from my resume - education, international work, languages, and interests to write a natural, personal bio paragraph and structured layout with my photo.

Decision:  
Accepted with small edits to tone and line spacing.

Reflection:

Using AI to support my website development made the process much more efficient. The tool helped me quickly structure the site, apply clean design standards, and troubleshoot issues like unbalanced layout and responsive styling. I still reviewed and customized each output to ensure it matched the assignment rubric and my personal tone. 

I learned that AI works best as a supportive assistant it accelerates setup and formatting, but the final polish still requires human judgment. Overall, this definitely improved my understanding of HTML and CSS.
